# Scalping Grid Trading Bot

## Description
This code is a sample implementation of a scalping grid trading bot. It is designed to place buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels within a grid, with the aim of profiting from small price movements. The bot uses a grid size, step size, range, stop loss, and take profit parameters to determine the placement of orders. It also includes risk management features such as a maximum drawdown limit.
